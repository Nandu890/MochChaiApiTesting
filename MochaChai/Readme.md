## [Referred Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSVw3TyZur4&list=PL6AdzyjjD5HDR2kNRU2dA1C8ydXRAaaBV&index=2)

**SuperTest** --- For API call
**Mocha**     --- Test Framework
**Chai**      --- Assertion libraries
**Babel (ES6+)** --- Use ES6 or above functionalities
**REST** ---Representational State Transfer (Representational State Transfer is a softaware architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating APIs.

# Architectural Constraints

1.Client - Server separation
2.Uniform Interface
3.Statelessness
4.Cacheability
5.Layered System
6.Code on Demand

## HTTP Request

© Base URI: where the request is being made from - htfps://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1
© HTIP Methods: what operation is being performed
© Headers: additional information passed to client and server
© Body: optional data to provide with the request

## FUNCTIONALITY

Testing the business logic of the application

## LOAD TESTING

Determining systems performance under specific expected load

## SECURITY TESTING

To check if the APIs are secure from external threats

## PENETRATION TESTING

To find security vulnerabilities that attacker could exploit

## Negative  Testing

To ensure APIs could handle invalid/wrong inputs

## Websites Used For Testing

#### [Go Rest](https://gorest.co.in/)

To get fake data

## Installation and run the Test

npm i chai mocha @babel/cli @babel/core @babel/node @babel/register @babel/preset-env  --save --dev
